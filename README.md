# Predicting the South African Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Markets using International Market Data

##1. Introduction

This paper examines the relationship between the international cryptocurrency market and the South African cryptocurrency market.
It is hypothesized that the South African market slightly lags the international market in terms of price movement. 
If this is the case and the relationship can be modelled it could lead to improvements in trading strategies for cryptocurrency traders.
It was found that...

This paper used data gathered from Kraken - an international cryptocurrency exchange - to represent the international cryptocurrency market 
and from VALR - a South African cryptocurrency exchange - to represent the South African market. In specific, the per minute pricing history
for the rand and dollar markets for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana were gathered from the two exchanges. Next the international markets were 
compared to the local markets to test for correlation and finally the relationships were modelled using multiple linear regressions, gradient 
boosting and neural network algorithms available from SciKit-Learn. 

The paper begins by describing the data collection process before detailing the methods of feature extraction used. 
Next, descriptive statistics are presented and their implications explained following which further data manipulation is undertaken 
in order to account for the idiosyncracies of the specific dataset. Next, the methods and results of the modelling process are presented and
finally the results are discussed in the conclusion.
